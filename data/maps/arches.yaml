    name: Arches National Park Visitor Center
    camping: none
    description: |
      A low-slung complex of stone and steel rises at the base of the cliffs,
      weather-colored to sit comfortably in its place. Inside: exhibits on arches’
      improbable physics, a relief map that makes route choices obvious, and rangers
      who’ve answered every version of “how long does Delicate Arch take?” Outside:
      water, shade structures, and a steady breeze crossing the parking lot. It’s the
      smart first stop—permits, restrooms, trail conditions—and a last good reality
      check before you trade air-conditioning for desert sun.
